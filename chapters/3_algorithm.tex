\section{Generalized framework for Signed Graphs Agglomerative Clustering} \label{sec:general_framework}
This section introduces the proposed generalized framework: 
%that represents a simple \UPDATE{generalized} formalization of many agglomerative graph clustering algorithms. \UPDATE{It can be used to describe both unsigned clustering algorithms ingesting positive node similarities and signed clustering algorithms using attractive and repulsive cues.}\\
we define the graph notation in Sec.~\ref{sec:notation}, introduce Algorithm \ref{main_alg} in Sec. \ref{sec:algorithm} and finally show how it can be seen as a generalization of existing and new graph clustering algorithms in Sec. \ref{sec:alg_update_rules}.

\subsection{Notation and graph formalism} \label{sec:notation}

We consider an undirected simple graph $\mathcal{G}(V,E)$, in which nodes can represent either pixels, superpixels or voxels. We call the set $\Pi$ a \emph{clustering} or \emph{partitioning} with $K$ clusters if $V = \cup_{i=1}^K S_i $, $S_i \cap S_j = \emptyset$ for each $i\neq j$ and every $S \in \Pi$ induces a connected subgraph of $\mathcal{G}$. We also denote as $S_u$ the cluster associated with node $u$.
% \begin{equation}
% S_u \equiv S \in \Pi \,\, \text{s.t.} \,\, u \in S
% \end{equation}

In this work, we consider the problem of clustering a weighted graph $\mathcal{G}(V,E,w^+, w^-)$ with both attractive and repulsive edge attributes. The weight function $w^+: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ associates a positive scalar attribute $w_e^+\in \mathbb{R}^+$ representing a merge affinity or a similarity measure: the higher this number, the higher the inclination of the two incident vertices to be assigned to the same cluster\footnote{Note that other formalisms \UPDATE{REFS} for positively weighted graphs associate distances to the edges, thus, the \emph{lower} the edge weight, the higher the attraction between the two linked nodes, contrary to our definition of $w^+$.}. On the other hand, $w^-: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ associates a split tendency $w_e^- \in \mathbb{R}^+$: the higher this weight, the more the incident vertices would like to be in different clusters. 
Graphs of the type $\mathcal{G}(V,E,w^+, w^-)$ are also often defined as \emph{signed graphs} $\mathcal{G}(V,E,\cost)$, featuring positive and negative edge weights $\cost_e\in \mathbb{R}$. Following the theoretical considerations in \cite{lange2018partial}, we define these signed weights as ${\cost_e = w_e^+ - w_e^-}$. Some approaches directly compute $\cost_e$, whereas others compute $w_e^+$ and $w_e^-$ separately.
In this formalism, graphs with purely attractive interactions are a special case of $\mathcal{G}(V,E,\cost)$ with $\cost_e \geq 0, \, \forall e \in E$.

\textbf{Inter-cluster interaction } We call two clusters $S_1,S_2$ \emph{adjacent} if there exists at least one edge ${e_{uv}\in E}$ connecting a node $u\in S_1$ to a node $v\in S_2$. In agglomerative HC, the interaction $\interact(S_1,S_2)$ between the two clusters is usually defined as a function, named \emph{linkage criterion}, depending on the weights of all edges connecting clusters $S_1$ and $S_2$. 
All the linkage criteria tested in this article are listed and defined in Table \ref{tab:linkage-criteria}.
% For example, for a \emph{maximum} linkage criterion statistic (single-linkage), the inter-cluster interaction is given by:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:max_linkage}
% \interact_{S_1,S_2} = \, \max_{e\in U(S_u,S_v)} \cost(e), \qquad \text{where}\quad E_{12} = \{ e_{uv} \in E | u \in S_1, \, v \in S_2 \}.
% \end{equation}
% Other common choices are \emph{minimum} (complete linkage) or \emph{average} (average linkage). %and \emph{sum}.

\textbf{Multicut and correlation clustering } For any clustering $\Pi$ of $\mathcal{G}$, we define as $E^{\mathrm{internal}}_\Pi$ the set of edges linking nodes in the same cluster, and as $E_\Pi^{\mathrm{external}}$ the complementary set of edges whose linked nodes belong to distinct clusters:
\begin{equation}
E_\Pi^{\mathrm{internal}} \equiv \{ e_{uv} \in E \,|\, \exists S \in \Pi : u \in S \, \text{and} \, v \in S \}, \qquad E^{\mathrm{external}}_\Pi \equiv E \setminus E^{\mathrm{internal}}_\Pi.
\end{equation}
% \begin{align}
% E_\Pi^0 &= \{ e_{uv} \in E \,|\, \exists S \in \Pi : u \in S \, \text{and} \, v \in S \}, \\
% E^1_\Pi &= E \setminus E^0_\Pi.
% \end{align}
The set of edges $E_\Pi^{\mathrm{external}}$ is known as the \emph{multicut} of $\mathcal{G}$ w.r.t. clustering $\Pi$. The instance of the NP-hard \emph{weighted correlation clustering/multicut problem} 
% w.r.t. $\mathcal{G}(V,E,\cost)$ 
corresponds to finding the partitioning that optimally balance attraction and repulsion in the graph and is given by the following binary integer program \cite{kappes2011globally,chopra1991multiway,andres2015lifting}:
\begin{equation}
% \min_\Pi \texttt{MC}(\Pi) \equiv
 \min_\Pi \sum_{e\in E} \cost_e x_e^\Pi,  \qquad \text{where} \quad x^\Pi_e = 
 \begin{cases} 
 1 & \text{if } e\in E^{\mathrm{external}}_\Pi \\
 0 & \text{otherwise}.
 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
In the next chapters we will use this objective as a way to measure how much a clustering is balanced.

\subsection{Generalized Algorithm for Signed Graphs Agglomerative Clustering} \label{sec:algorithm}

We now present a Generalized Algorithm for Signed Graphs Agglomerative Clustering (\algname) that describes several graph partitioning algorithms previously introduced in the literature and highlights the existence of new ones.

The proposed algorithm \ref{main_alg} uses a bottom-up approach starting with each node assigned to its own cluster and iteratively merges pairs of adjacent clusters. Intuitively, the algorithm starts by merging clusters with the strongest attractive interaction, corresponding to the highest positive weights in the graph, and it stops when the remaining clusters share only mutual repulsive interactions (see Fig. \hyperref[fig:intro_figure]{\ref*{fig:intro_figure}b} and \hyperref[fig:intro_figure]{\ref*{fig:intro_figure}c}). 

A second variant of the proposed algorithm also introduces \emph{cannot-link constraints}, representing mutual exclusion relationships between pairs of nodes that cannot be associated with the same cluster in the final clustering. This variant (Algorithm \ref{main_alg} with \texttt{addCannotLinkConstraints=True}) stops when all the remaining clusters have been previously constrained.
% The algorithm that we will present in the next section iteratively performs a sequence of so-called \emph{edge contractions} on the original graph $\mathcal{G}(V,E,w^+, w^-)$.
% The graph clustering algorithm we will present in Sec. \ref{sec:algorithm} is a bottom-up approach starting with each node assigned to its own cluster and iteratively merging clusters. During the agglomeration, the current clustering $\Pi$ is represented by a \emph{contracted graph} $\mathcal{G'}(\mathcal{G}, \Pi)$, such that each of its nodes represents a cluster $S \in \Pi$ and \emph{adjacent} clusters are linked by an edge. 


% For the linkage criteria tested in this work, when two clusters $S_u$ and $S_v$ are merged, the interactions between the new cluster $S_u \cup S_v$ and each of its neighbors depend only on the previous interactions involving $S_u$ and $S_v$. Thus, we can easily recompute these interactions by using a simple \emph{update rule} $f$ that does not involve any loop over the edges of the original graph $\mathcal{G}$. As an example, given the single-linkage criterion defined in Eq. \ref{eq:max_linkage}, the interaction between $S_u \cup S_v$ and one of its neighbors $S_t$ is simply given by:
% \begin{equation}
%   \interact_{S_u \cup S_v,S_t} = f( \interact_{S_u,S_t}, \interact_{S_v,S_t}) = f(\tilde{\cost}(e_{ut}), \tilde{\cost}(e_{vt})) = \max \{ \tilde{\cost}(e_{ut}), \tilde{\cost}(e_{vt}) \}
% \end{equation}
% All the update rules tested in this article are listed in Table \ref{tab:linkage-criteria}.

\UPDATE{\textbf{The proposed edge contraction algorithm } Algorithm \ref{main_alg} then proceeds as follows, similarly to the one presented in \cite{levinkov2017comparative}. It starts with each node assigned to its own cluster and sorts all edges $e\in E$ in a priority queue (PQ) by their absolute weight $|\cost_e|=|w_e^+ - w_e^-|$ in descending order, so that the most attractive and the most repulsive interactions are processed first. It then iteratively pops one edge $e_{uv}$ from PQ and, depending on the priority $\tilde{\cost}$, does the following: in case of attractive interaction $\tilde{\cost}>0$, provided that $e_{uv}$ was not flagged as a cannot-link constraint, then merge the connected clusters, perform an edge contraction of $e_{uv}$ in $\tilde{\mathcal{G}}_\Pi$ and update the priorities of new double edges as explained in Fig. \ref{fig:edge_contraction_and_contr_graph}. 
% For every new pair of double edges in $\tilde{\mathcal{G}}_\Pi$, update their priorities according to one of the update rules listed in Table \ref{tab:linkage-criteria} together with their cannot-link relationships. 
If, on the other hand, the interaction is repulsive ($\tilde{\cost}\leq 0$) and the option \texttt{addCannotLink} of Alg. \ref{main_alg} is \texttt{True}, then the edge $e_{uv}$ is flagged as cannot-link constraint.
In the Supplementary material we comment on the algorithm computational complexity (Sec. \ref{sec:complexity}).}

% Given a clustering $\Pi$ and a graph $\mathcal{G}(V,E,W)$, the interaction between two clusters $S_1, S_2 \in \Pi$ is usually defined in terms of a \emph{linkage criterion}, i.e. a function of all the edge weights connecting the two clusters:
% \begin{equation} 
% \begin{gathered}
% \mathcal{L}(S_1,S_2) = \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{W})\quad \\

\subsection{Different update rules: new and existing algorithms} \label{sec:alg_update_rules}
%In this section, we show how the choice of different update rules for the presented generalized algorithm \algname{} leads to existing and new algorithms (see Table \ref{tab:linkage-criteria}).

In the special case of an unsigned graph with only positive interactions, i.e. $w_e^-=0$ and $\cost_e \geq 0$ $\forall e\in E$, %$\mathcal{G}(V,E,W:E\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+)$ 
 the algorithm performs a standard agglomerative HC by returning only one single cluster and a hierarchy of clusters defined by the order in which the clusters are merged (see Fig. \hyperref[fig:intro_figure]{\ref*{fig:intro_figure}} - left panel), where the choice of update rule determines the type of linkage (Table \ref{tab:linkage-criteria}, unsigned graphs).

Given a graph with both attractive and repulsive cues, an edge contraction algorithm with a sum update rule was already proposed in \cite{levinkov2017comparative,keuper2015efficient} (Table \ref{tab:linkage-criteria}, \emph{Sum} linkage). They present both a version with cannot-link constraints and one without, and then compare them with other greedy local-search algorithms solving the multicut optimization problem.

The Mutex Watershed \cite{wolf2018mutex}, another algorithm for signed graph partitioning, also introduces dynamical cannot-link constraints. In the supplementary material (Sec. \ref{sec:equivalence_MWS}) we show how it can be seen as an efficient implementation of \algname{} with the \emph{Absolute maximum} linkage defined in Table \ref{tab:linkage-criteria} and observe that in this case \algname{} returns the same clustering with or without enforcing cannot-link constraints.

On the other hand, to our knowledge, the presented agglomerative algorithm with \emph{Average}, \emph{Max} or \emph{Min} linkage was never applied to signed graphs or combined with cannot-link constraints, thus we decided to test all these new variations. 

\UPDATE{Additional types of linkage criteria were proposed in the literature}:
\cite{nunez2013machine} for example proposed a learned update rule where a neural network updates the cluster interactions depending on predefined edge and node features; other approaches introduce a weight regularization depending on the size of the clusters \cite{felzenszwalb2004efficient,kardoostsolving}, whereas 
\cite{funke2018large} uses a \emph{quantile} linkage criteria by populating a histogram for each inter-cluster interaction. \UPDATE{To our knowledge, the linkage criteria listed in Table \ref{tab:linkage-criteria} represent the most used ones, thus we include them in our experimental comparison presented in the next chapters.}
