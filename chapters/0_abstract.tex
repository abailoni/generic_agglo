%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
We propose a novel theoretical framework that generalizes algorithms for hierarchical agglomerative clustering to weighted graphs with both attractive and repulsive interactions between the nodes. This framework defines an underlying basic algorithm and allows us to explore its combinations with different linkage criteria and cannot-link constraints, i.e. mutual exclusion between clusters. These different combinations then correspond to existing clustering methods as well as new algorithms that we introduce and analyze. We evaluate these different algorithms on instance segmentation, which is the task of partitioning an image into distinct segments, by predicting edge weights with a CNN. \UPDATE{Summarize results}
