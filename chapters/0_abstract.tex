%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
We propose a novel theoretical framework that generalizes algorithms for hierarchical agglomerative clustering to weighted graphs with both attractive and repulsive interactions between the nodes. This framework defines an underlying basic algorithm and allows us to explore its combinations with different linkage criteria and cannot-link constraints, i.e. mutual exclusion between clusters. We then prove how these different combinations correspond to existing clustering methods as well as new algorithms that we introduce and analyze. 
An extensive comparison study is performed to evaluate properties of the clustering algorithms, e.g. robustness and efficiency, by applying them to instance segmentation, which is the task of partitioning an image into distinct segments. 
% and by predicting edge weights with a CNN. 
We then show how one of the new algorithms proposed in our framework outperforms all previously known agglomerative methods for signed graphs, both on the competitive CREMI 2016 EM segmentation benchmark and the CityScapes dataset.
