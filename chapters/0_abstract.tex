%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
\TODO{Update} We propose a new theoretical framework that generalizes algorithms for hierarchical agglomerative clustering to weighted graphs with both attractive and repulsive interactions between the nodes. This framework defines GASP, a Generalized Algorithm for Signed graph Partitioning, and allows us to explore many combinations of different linkage criteria and cannot-link constraints. We prove the equivalence of existing clustering methods to some of those combinations, and introduce new algorithms for combinations which have not been studied before. 
On stochastic block model problems, GASP compares favorably to spectral clustering. More importantly, we conduct a systematic comparison of various instantiations of GASP in image instance segmentation problems, in terms of accuracy but also efficiency and robustness to noise. 
We find that one of the new algorithms proposed in our framework outperforms all previously known agglomerative methods for signed graphs, both on the competitive CREMI 2016 EM segmentation benchmark and on the CityScapes dataset.
