%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
We propose a novel theoretical framework that generalizes algorithms for hierarchical agglomerative clustering to weighted graphs with both attractive and repulsive interactions between the nodes. This framework defines an underlying basic algorithm and allows us to explore its combinations with different linkage criteria and cannot-link constraints. We prove the equivalence of the existing clustering methods to some of those combinations and introduce new algorithms for combinations which have not been studied yet. An extensive comparison is performed to evaluate properties of the clustering algorithms, e.g. robustness and efficiency, by applying them to the problem of instance segmentation in images. We show how one of the new algorithms proposed in our framework outperforms all previously known agglomerative methods for signed graphs, both on the competitive CREMI 2016 EM segmentation benchmark and on the CityScapes dataset.
