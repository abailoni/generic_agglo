\section{Estimating edge weights}
\begin{itemize}
\item Define predictions of the classifier (pseudo probabilities) for edge weights
\item Define possible mappings to signed costs
\item Make comment about which version defines nested segmentations and which does not give hirarchical solutions

\end{itemize}
