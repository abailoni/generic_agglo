\subsection{Data: CREMI challenge} \label{sec:cremi_challenge}
We evaluate the algorithms in our framework on the competitive CREMI 2016 EM Segmentation Challenge \cite{cremiChallenge} that is currently the neuron segmentation challenge with the largest amount of training data available. The dataset comes from serial section EM of \emph{Drosophila} fruit-fly tissue and consists of 6 volumes of 1250x1250x125 voxels at resolution 4x4x40nm, three of which present publicly available training ground truth. The results submitted to the leaderboard are evaluated using the CREMI score (\url{https://cremi.org/leaderboard/}), based on the Adapted Rand-Score (Rand-Score) and the Variation of Information Score \cite{arganda2015crowdsourcing}. In Appendix \ref{sec:cremi_details}, we provide more details about the training of our CNN model, inspired by work of \cite{lee2017superhuman,funke2018large}.
