\subsection{Evaluating different update rules} \label{sec:exp_first_comparison}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Highlight difference of the sum in Fig. \ref{fig:intro_figure}
  % \item compare different choices of signed-cost-mappings (say which one worked best)
  \item present cremi crop-C table and rule out single and complete linkage
\end{itemize}

Among the update rules listed in Table \ref{tab:linkage-criteria}, in the next sections we will only focus on \emph{sum}, \emph{arithmetic mean} and \emph{absolute maximum}, since they performed best in these experiments.
