\subsection{Experimental setup and tested datasets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define long-range grid graph. (Mention the fact of enforcing local merge)
\item Introduce "Poisson" random graph with a given probability of long-range connections
\item Comment about the short- and long-range distinction in the MWS paper? It does not work that well in practice (applying post-processing to remove small segments is easier and better solution).
\item Ad of course we can think about a classifier that separately predict attraction and repulsion
\item Define offset patterns (link to supplementary material), trained networks (loss, etc...) and setups on cremi and cityscapes 
\item Mention postprocessing step: get rid of tiny segments; on CREMI we use watershed to fill the deleted parts 
\end{itemize}
